# GNUMP3d Player

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

HTML5 audio player frontend for the  [GNUMP3d](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnump3d/) media streaming server by Steve Kemp. The player ignores all the extra features of the server (sorry, Steve) and builds its own library from recursing the root folder. The output will depend on how you have organized your files.

The player includes the ability to create a playlist of multiple files and/or folders. Controls are otherwise pretty minimal.


### Installation ###

The simplest way to install the player is to clone this repo into the GNUMP3d templates folder and point the configuration file there.
